ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Ever since it’s arrival, people have been using it for a variety of different purposes. The problem with these prompts is that, slowly, we are getting more dependent. When we use it way too much, we gradually stop using our brain. We’d just ask ChatGPT the question and we’ll get our answer.

We’re literally making our own brain shrink and getting spoon-fed by an AI. More and more educational institutions are banning the use of ChatGPT, all because students are exploiting it and asking it to write their essays. This is just making them more dependent on AI. We’re just degrading ourselves by relying on AI to do our student work for us.

I’m not saying we shouldn’t use ChatGPT, for, it is a great resource! You can make magic happen, if it is used correctly.

If you’re writing essays, use it as a tool, use it to check if your sentences are grammatically correct. You can use it to gather facts quickly. You can ask it for synonyms, punctuations, anything! It’s a great writing assistant.

You can also use it to ask for writing prompts. You can ask it for article ideas on a certain topic, poetry prompts, etc. It’s good for getting over writer’s block.

You can even ask it to summarize topics and even entire chapters. It’s extremely useful for students.

One can ask it for advice, it’s literally free e-therapy, from an AI… I mean, therapy is therapy. I’m actually surprised with the advice it gives.

Not only that, but I also use it as my coding assistant. I can ask it how to do a certain thing or how to make a certain thing. It’s been of great use to me while building websites.

The sky is the limit with ChatGPT. It’ll only get better and better over time. Let’s just hope we won’t reach a point when AI will overthrow us.

At the end of the day, just remember that it’s for one’s own sake, ChatGPT shouldn’t be used to cheat.
