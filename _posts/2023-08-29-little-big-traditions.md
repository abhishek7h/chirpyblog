I wonder if everyone has these personal traditions, something that they do every year. I don't mean it religiously, something for personal satisfaction.

I have this little tradition, where, for every Onam, I rewatch the movie Jacobinte Swargarajyam with my parents. I think I've done this for the past 3 years. For those of you who don't know about the movie Jacobinte Swargarajyam, it's a feel-good movie about this Malayali guy in Dubai that runs a big business, but is forced to go back to Kerala because of a huge debt after a friend of his betrays him. This movie has a part where they all celebrate Onam in Dubai, and that has people going crazy. The famous song Thiruvaavaniraavu is from that movie, and if you attend any Onam program, (especially during the time of Thiruvathira) you won't fail to hear that song. It has captured the hearts of Malayalis since 2016.

Everyone must have such traditions, should they not? Do you have such a tradition? Well, if you don't, you should make up a tradition. It's fun.
