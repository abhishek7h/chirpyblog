Dear all,
\
Thank you for your overwhelming support and wishes. To have won four prizes and Kalaprathibha in my maiden Kalanjali has left me very surprised! These past few days have been amazing and I can't believe what all has happened. Kudos to everyone who participated. Trivandrum acquired 505 points and secured 2nd place in overall points. Hopefully, next time, even more people will participate. It has been an amazing weekend and it's a memory I'll cherish. Let's hope we, Trivandrum, can host the next Kalanjali. Once again, thank you and congratulations to all.
