I might have found a way to live life happily. The secret, that might not be, is to just be fearless. Our life is controlled and restricted by the element of fear. If, if, if, we eliminate “fear”, we could enjoy life way more.

You’re scared to go up and talk to someone. Ask yourself this one question; why? Is that person going to eat you? Is that person going to harm you? If not, why should fear be induced?

I like to believe that it is due to fear that we are missing out on big events that will serve as a memory in our lives. I may have also somewhat pinpointed what exactly we’re scared of.

We might be scared of embarrassment, failure or fear of getting hurt or into trouble. Getting hurt or getting into trouble can be justified. But there is no need to be afraid of embarrassment or failure.

I am going to categorize fear of embarrassment into two, while with close friends and while with colleagues and the kind. There is no need to feel embarrassed while trying something when you’re with your friends. You’re only creating memories that you’ll cherish one day. But with colleagues and all, if you don’t want to do something, then don’t. But if you think it’s wise to do it in front of colleagues, do so. But with friends, there is no need to worry.

The fear of failure. A thing familiar to many, but celebrated by none. I like to trust the notion that if we haven’t personally tried something, we won’t know how hard it is, and failure is just a process of mastering something. How do you think musicians pull off perfect chords and notes every single time? Hours and hours of blood, sweat and tears led them to this. They were once very bad at what they now do to earn a living. They have failed a chord or note countless times. So, they corrected themselves. They worked hard. But the world only sees their final performance and thinks that they have natural talent and if they tried to do it, they won’t be able to.

If we live fearlessly, we could definitely live happier. At least I will keep on believing that.
