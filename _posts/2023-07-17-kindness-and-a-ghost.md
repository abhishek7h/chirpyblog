Kindness is a virtue,

It's not very hard to do,

It'll probably benefit you.

Teach someone how to tie a shoe,

It'll give you someone to woo,

And that ghost of yours won't boo.

Teach someone how to brew,

It'll definitely excite your crew,

And that ghost of yours won't hew.

Teach someone what you once knew,

It'll help them enjoy the dew,

And that ghost of yours won't mew.

Teach someone not to skip the queue,

People will definitely start to like you,

And that ghost of yours won't loudly chew.
