I like to believe that there are two types of people in the world, and they can be classified by handing them a glass of water. But the catch here is, the glass should not be filled completely. You take that glass up to a person and you ask them about it. If they say it's "half full", then you've found yourself an optimist. I'm not going to really go over the "half empty" person, because to be frank, it's going to be the most common reply. Our brain automatically considers the glass to be half empty, because we are expecting a glass of water filled to the brim when we ask someone for it.

But if in a rare occasion the person says it's "half full", then brilliant. They are pretty optimistic. They like to look at the positive side of everything. It's honestly very good to be that kind of a person. People like glass half full people. Such people are considered to be very nice. For someone's brain to automatically respond with "this glass is half-full, good!", a lot of optimism is required.

We all should try to be a glass half full person. It is a good idea to have that attitude even if it's just for a day. It allows us to be grateful for what we have and enjoy life. We should try our very best to look into the bright side of things. It's good for our own mental health. We ought to give our brain a break from all our nonsensical worries. We must give ourselves a break from the negativity all around over lives, because it's only when we stop looking around the negativity around us that we realize of all the positivity around us.
