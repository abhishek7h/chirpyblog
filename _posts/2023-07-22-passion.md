As far as I can remember,

It’s what I’ve wanted to become

The thought just hung

And it felt right

It brought me joy

And a sense of fulfilment

I knew I was meant to be.
\
\
"But what would the society think?" they say,

Who cares?

It's my life, let me live.

It's my life, let me choose.

It's my passion,

It's all I care about

And I will succeed.
\
\
A dancer's passion,
\
With each graceful move.
\
\
An artist's passion,
\
With each stroke of the brush.
\
\
A photographer's passion,
\
With each click.
\
\
A writer's passion,
\
With each word.
\
\
I too want to show the world

That following your passion

Doesn't mean failure.

It symbolizes one's success instead

To have been able to make a living

From doing what one loves.
That's passion.
